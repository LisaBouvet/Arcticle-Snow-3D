abstract = {Of critical importance for avalanche forecasting, is the ability to draw meaningful conclusions from only a handful of field observations. To that end, it is common for avalanche forecasters to not only have to rely on sparse data, but also on their own intuitive understanding of how their field-based observations may be correlated to complex physical processes responsible for structural instability within a snowpack. One such well-documented basis for mechanical instability to increase within a snowpack is that caused by the presence of a buried ice lens or ice crust. Although such icy layers are naturally formed and frequently encountered in seasonal snowpacks, very little is known about the microstructural evolution of these layers and how they contribute toward weak layer development. Furthermore, in terms of assessing the structural integrity of the snowpack, there is at the present time no consistent treatment for identifying these layers a priori as problematic or benign. To address this issue, we have created an idealized laboratory scenario in which we can study how an artificially created ice lens may affect the thermophysical and microstructural state of the interface between the ice lens and adjacent layers of snow while under a controlled temperature gradient of primarily −100Km−1. Utilizing in situ micro-thermocouple measurements, our findings show that a super-temperature gradient exists within only a millimeter of the ice lens surface that is many times greater than the imposed bulk temperature gradient. Such large temperature gradients on such a small scale would not be measurable by most field-based instrumentation and to our knowledge these laboratory-based in situ measurements are the first of their kind. Additionally, we have also investigated and characterized the microstructural evolution of the ice–snow interface with X-ray Micro-computed Tomography and Scanning Electron Microscopy. In our analysis, we have been able to identify distinct regions of simultaneous ice crystal growth, sublimation, and kinetic snow metamorphism. We hold that these observations are both consistent with previous laboratory studies and observations made in the natural environment.}

In our detailed analysis, we have focused primarily on the observed temperature gradients from within one millimeter above and below the ice–snow interface, as measured in our laboratory prepared specimen. Our findings show via a simple one-dimensional model for energy balance that thermal contact resistance followed by decreases in the effective thermal conductivity are the primary contributors to the dramatic increases in the local temperature gradient near the ice–snow interface. Additional mechanisms for heat and mass transfer are also reviewed in our analysis, including the water vapor flux and latent heat flux.}

abstract = {The morphological changes of individual snowflakes evolving within a dry snow aggregate have been studied using X-ray computed microtomography (micro-CT). Fresh dry snow was collected during a snowfall, sealed, and stored in a  −5°C cold room between periodic observations using micro-CT. Time series 3-D images were used to examine the structural evolution of an individual snowflake within the aggregate over a 2-month period, after which the snowflake had lost its original dendritic structure. Analysis of the aggregate showed that the fraction of large ice particles increased over this period while the total number of particles decreased, presumably to lower the free energy of the snow specimen. This approach enables the study of metamorphism of individual snowflakes in a local environment close to that found in nature. The evolution of structural parameters, including the volume fraction of ice, the surface-to-volume ratio of the ice matrix, the thickness and separation of the ice structure determined by the distance transform of the ice and pore space, were monitored and analyzed using coarsening theories. The computed growth exponent was smaller than the values obtained in the earlier work by Legagneux et al. (2004) and Kaempfer and Schneebeli (2007), who also interpreted the isothermal metamorphism in terms of coarsening theories.},

abstract = {A new numerical method for tracking interface motion in microstructures is described and used to simulate two-dimensional, transient-stage Ostwald ripening at high volume fractions of coarsening phase. Two limiting kinetic regimes are explicitly simulated, namely diffusion-controlled mass transport and surface-attachment/detachment-limited kinetics (SALK). The simulations indicate important qualitative and quantitative differences between these two mechanisms at high volume fractions. These differences include: (1) The persistence of coalescence events under SALK that are completely absent under diffusion control; and (2) stable circular shapes for isolated domains under SALK; under diffusion control, the morphology of an isolated domain is dependent on its nearby surroundings, as reported by other investigators. Spatial correlations amongst the coarsening domains are also investigated using two-point correlation functions and medium polarization functions.}
