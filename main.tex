\begin{abstract}

Representing snow equi-temperature metamorphism (ETM) is key to model the evolution and properties of the snow cover. Recently, a phase-field model describing the mean curvature flow on 3-D microstructures was proposed \cite{bretin_phase-field_2019}. In the present work, this model is used to simulate ETM at the pore scale, considering the only process of moving interfaces by sublimation-deposition driven by curvatures. We take 3-D micro-tomographic images of snow as input in the model and obtain a time series of simulated microstructures as output. Relating the numerical time, as defined in the model, to the real, physical time involves the condensation coefficient, a poorly-constrained parameter in literature. A calibration step was thus done;  we fit simulated microstructures to experimental ones, matching the evolution of the specific surface area (SSA) during ETM at  -2°C.  A value of $(9.8\pm0.7)10^{-4}$ is obtained and used in all the following simulations. The calibrated model enables to well reproduce an independent time series of ETM at -2°C in terms of SSA, covariance length, and mean curvature distribution. Finally, we use the calibrated model to investigate the effect of ETM on four different snow microstructures. As an interesting preliminary result, we observe an enhancement of the structural anisotropy in the case of initially anisotropic microstructures. Also, the potential of such model to provide predictions of effective properties of snow under ETM is illustrated. The evolution of transport properties (thermal conductivity, vapor diffusion, permeability) is presented and while some morphological effects are observed, their values mainly follow the current density-relationship parameterizations.

\section*{Plain Language Summary}

Snow on the ground is a skeleton of ice and air evolving continuously under different environmental constraints. Among them, equi-temperature metamorphism (ETM) refers to the smoothing and rounding of the snow structure under the effect of curvature differences at the ice grain surface. It is one of the main mechanisms of snow evolution and its correct representation is crucial for ETM modeling. Here, we use a mean curvature flow model, describing the smoothing of 3-D microstructures, to simulate ETM of snow. 3-D micro-tomographic images of snow samples are used as input; the output is a time series of 3-D images showing ETM evolution. The ETM rate is classically driven by the condensation coefficient. This parameter is however still poorly-constrained in literature. We estimate it by fitting the model to experimental data of ETM at -2$^\circ$C. A value of $(9.8\pm0.7)10^{-4}$ is derived. Good agreement is reported when comparing the fitted model to an independent experimental time-series. Finally, we model ETM for four different snow microstructures. The simulated images are then used to predict the evolution structural and macro-scale transport properties. Overall, this work presents promising tools for snow metamorphism study and the development of predictive means for large scale snow models. 

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Dry snow laying on the ground is a complex material made of an ice skeleton in an air matrix that undergoes continuous transformations. Especially, snow evolves through processes of mass redistribution due to thermodynamic mechanisms called snow metamorphism. Different types of snow metamorphism take place depending on the temperature and humidity conditions as well as on the snow microstructure itself. Considering metamorphism is key as it impacts snowpack physical properties, including mechanical properties involved in avalanche processes or thermo-physical properties that drive the surface energy budget of snowpacks \cite{lehning_physical_2002, vionnet_detailed_2012}.\\

Equi-temperature metamorphism (ETM), also referred to as isothermal metamorphism, occurs in snow in quasi-isothermal conditions and is driven by curvature gradients at the ice-air interface. Low curvature ice surfaces have a lower saturation water vapor density than the high curvature ones. Those curvature gradients lead thus to gradients of saturation vapor density causing vapor transfer across the pores (e.g. diffusion) as well as phase changes (sublimation and deposition). Ice sublimates in higher curvature surfaces while  water vapor deposits on lower curvature surfaces. 
The overall structure of snow gets rounder, coarser, and more sintered \cite{colbeck_thermodynamics_1980}. These morphological changes come together with mechanical grain rearrangement leading to snow settling. The resulting type of snow is referred to as rounded grains (RG) by \textit{The International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground} \cite{fierz2009international}. Equi-temperature metamorphism is constantly taking place in snow but at different levels of intensity. The higher the contrast in curvature and the higher the snow temperature, the more active the equi-temperature metamorphism. In the presence of high temperature gradients, the influence of curvature effects becomes insignificant as the effect of the temperature gradient metamorphism (TGM) predominates.\\

Modeling the physical processes of metamorphism at fine scale requires the  description of the snow microstructure and its evolution (moving interfaces) as well as water vapor transport across the microstructure. Models can be applied on simplified geometry, as in  the work of \citeA{miller_microstructural_2003} who considered a 2D regular network of spherical grains. They can also take as input real snow microstructures, for example 3-D images of elementary representative volume (REV) of snow obtained from micro-tomography ($\upmu$CT). To enable micro-scale 3-D modeling, different hypotheses can be used, describing kinetics at the interface, with or without vapor diffusion and settling. \citeA{flin_full_2003} considered fully curvature-driven ETM based on the kinetic limited assumption, and simulated it with an iterative method on 3-D tomographic images. Comparisons between modeled and experimental microstructures were also shown. Also, a first simple grain rearrangement model was used to account for settling \cite{flin2004snow}. Similarly, \citeA{vetter_simulating_2010} used a Monte-Carlo algorithm to simulate the isothermal metamorphism with the kinetic limited assumption and implemented a simple settling model. They obtained consistent results with observations although the model rely on experimental fitting.\\
Recently, phase-field models have been developed to handle the numerical cost and complexity of 3-D micro-scale models \cite{bretin_phase-field_2019,granger_physique_2019,   kaempfer_phase-field_2009}. \citeA{kaempfer_phase-field_2009} suggested a phase-field model for snow metamorphism considering interface kinetics and diffusion. They were pioneers with the phase-field method applied to snow metamorphism, and their results are consistent with observations. However, evaluations are qualitative and limited only to one temperature gradient case, mainly because of the numerical cost of the model. 
\citeA{bretin_phase-field_2019} developed a very efficient phase-field multi-phase growth model for curvature-driven interface evolution, which is typically relevant for ETM.\\
Modeling the physics of snow growth classically relies on a condensation parameter $\alpha$ \cite<e.g.,>{ flin_full_2003, kaempfer_phase-field_2009, libbrecht2005physics, yokoyama1990pattern}. This parameter embodies the surface physics that governs how water molecules are incorporated into the ice lattice and is thus key to model metamorphism. The $\alpha$ coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. One can think of $\alpha$ as a sticking probability, equal to the probability that a water vapor molecule striking the ice surface becomes assimilated into the crystal lattice \cite{furukawa2015snow, libbrecht2005physics}. However, it is still poorly understood and quantified, notably because of its complex dependencies to temperature, humidity and crystalline orientation. Numerous values can be found in the literature, ranging from 10$^{-3}$ to 10$^{-1}$ \cite<e.g.,>{libbrecht_measurements_2013}. The large uncertainty on this coefficient is one of the main limiting factor for metamorphism models accuracy.\\
%
To evaluate 3-D models, simulated images are usually compared to experimental data through microstructural properties that can be calculated on 3-D microstructures. Specific surface area (SSA), growth speed, ice thickness and mean curvature were used in previous studies \cite{flin_full_2003, vetter_simulating_2010}. In \citeA{kaempfer_phase-field_2009}, the model results are compared to a 1D pseudo-analytical case using the growth speed variable. Another way of evaluation, not explored yet, could be based on macro-scale properties, which can also be calculated on simulated 3-D images \cite<e.g.,>{calonne_numerical_2011, calonne_study_2014, courville2010lattice, kaempfer2005microstructural, srivastava2010observation}. It would enable comparison with well established regressions and models from literature.\\

In this article we intend to go further in the micro-scale modeling of ETM by presenting an efficient phase-field algorithm applicable on tomographic images of snow and by calibrating it through the condensation coefficient parameter at -2°C. A uncommon aspect of snow physics is investigated with the discussion of microstructural and macro-scale transport properties calculated on simulated images.
The paper is organized as follows. The model and the tools used for snow analysis are shown along with the model calibration in section \ref{sec:method}. Evaluation of the calibrated model and ETM prediction for different snow microstructures are investigated in section \ref{sec:results}. Section \ref{sec:disc} discuss in details the model artefacts and the different results of the paper. Finally, section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the manuscript.

%PHASE FIELD ET MODELE NUMERIQUE
The phase-field model of \citeA{bretin_phase-field_2019} simulates a multi-phase medium evolving under mean curvature flow and volume conservation of each phase. This flow is defined by an interface evolution where the normal velocity $v_n$ is proportional to the local interface curvature C. In our case, we consider two phases where the model minimizes local curvatures while conserving the average of the sample mean curvature (equivalent to mass conservation of the ice phase). The morphological transformations induced by the mean curvature flow can be interpreted as ``smoothing" surfaces and is typically well-suited to model ETM as it is based on the same mathematical description. 

% APPLICATION A LA NEIGE (EQUATIONS ETC)
We apply the model of \citeA{bretin_phase-field_2019} to ETM. This implies that we assume the kinetic-limited metamorphism: vapor transport in the pore space (diffusion) is not described. The latter is considered instantaneous, so that vapor density in air is constant and at equilibrium with temperature and with the ambient sample mean curvature. Also, temperature is considered isotropic and constant. Finally, the model does not include any mechanics and the settling of the ice grains is thus not represented here.\\

Under those conditions, ETM is classically described by the following set of equations \cite<e.g.>{flin_full_2003, kaempfer_phase-field_2009}:  \
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:hertz_knu}
\begin{align}
v_{n} &= \alpha v_{\mathrm{kin}} \frac{\rho_{vs}^{\mathrm{amb}} - \rho_{v s}^{\Gamma}}{\rho_{v s}^{ \Gamma }}\quad \text{on}\ \Gamma\text{,} 
\end{align}
\begin{align}
v_{\mathrm{kin}} &= \frac{\rho_{v s}^{\mathrm{ref}}}{\rho_i}\sqrt{\frac{k T}{2 \pi m}} % vérifier la formulation de vkin ?
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\label{equ:gibbsa}
    \rho_{vs}^{\mathrm{amb}}=\rho_{vs}^{\mathrm{ref}}\ e^{d_0 C^{\mathrm{amb}}}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\label{equ:gibbsb}
    \rho_{vs}^{\Gamma}=\rho_{vs}^{\mathrm{ref}}\ e^{d_0 C} \quad \text{on}\ \Gamma\text{,} 
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\noindent Equation \eqref{eq:hertz_knu} is the Hertz-Knudsen equation. The velocity normal on the interface and oriented toward the air $v_n$ is related to the difference between the ambient saturation vapor density in the pores $\rho_{vs}^{\mathrm{amb}}$ and the saturation vapor density at the interface $\rho_{vs}^{\Gamma}$. We see in this equation that the interface growth velocity - the ETM rate - depends linearly on the condensation coefficient $\alpha$.\\

\noindent Equation \eqref{equ:gibbsa} is the Gibbs-Thomson relation applied to the ambient saturated vapor density in the pores $\rho_{vs}^{\mathrm{amb}}$ in equilibrium with the whole sample mean curvature $C^{\mathrm{amb}}$. Equation \eqref{equ:gibbsb} is also the Gibbs-Thomson relation, applied to the interface saturated water density $\rho_{vs}^{\Gamma}$ at an interface of local curvature $C$. It describes dependencies between saturation vapor density and curvatures using the capillary length $d_0 = \lambda a^3/(k T)$ (m) \cite{kaempfer_phase-field_2009}.\\ 
  
 \noindent $\rho_{vs}^\mathrm{ref}$ is the saturation vapor density in air above a flat surface. It has been largely studied, and can be determined as a function of the temperature using one of the existing parameterizations. We use the formulation of \citeA{gofflow}, which is appropriated for our range of temperature and can be found in \citeA{murphy2005review}. All the variables, typical values and units are presented in Table \ref{tab:variables}.

\end{table}


The mean curvature flow model of \citeA{bretin_phase-field_2019} is solved with the phase-field method which enables an implicit description of the interface using a function that varies smoothly between different phases. When adapted and applied to ETM with two-phases, air and ice, the phase-field equation can be expressed as:\\
\begin{equation}\label{eq:phase-field}\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x, t)= d_0 \alpha v_{\mathrm{kin}} \left(\Delta u(x, t)-\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2}} W^{\prime}(u)\right)\end{equation}
\noindent with $x$ the position, $t$ the time and $u$ the phase function defined as: \begin{equation}\label{eq:phase-func}
u(x,t) := \frac{1}{2}\left(1-\tanh\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\right)\frac{d(x,t)}{\varepsilon}
\end{equation}
with $s$ the curvilinear  abscissa of the phase function, $d$ the distance function from the interface $\Gamma$, $\varepsilon$ the interface sharpness parameter, and $W$ a double-well potential $W(s):= s^{2}(1-s)^{2}/2$. The distance function is linked to the surface local curvature $C$ by $\Delta d(x) = C$ and to the interface normal speed $v_n$ by $\partial_t d (x,t) = - v_n$. By substituting the physical variables to non-dimensional variables such as: $\Tilde{t} = t \alpha v_{\mathrm{kin}} d_0 / d_x^2 $, $\Tilde{x} = x/d_x$ and $\Tilde{\varepsilon} = \varepsilon/d_x$ with $d_x$ (m) the input image resolution, the canonical dimensionless form of equation \ref{eq:phase-field} is the famous Allen-Cahn equation \cite{bretin_and_denis_discrete-continuous_2015, kaempfer_phase-field_2009}:
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:allen-cahn}\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x, t)=\Delta u(x, t)-\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2}} W^{\prime}(u)\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:allen-cahn}\frac{\partial \Tilde{u}}{\partial \Tilde{t}}(\Tilde{x}, \Tilde{t})=\Delta \Tilde{u}(\Tilde{x}, \Tilde{t})-\frac{1}{\Tilde{\varepsilon}^{2}} W^{\prime}(\Tilde{u})\end{equation}

%     \label{fig:disco}
% \end{figure}

The equation \eqref{eq:allen-cahn} is the general form of the phase-field equation. In the model another term is added on the form of a Lagrangian multiplier to guarantee the volume conservation \cite<See>{bretin_phase-field_2019}.



The resulting phase-field software is called Snow-3D. The model takes as input a 3-D binary image of snow microstructure that can be derived from a snow tomography, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:eboni_sous_volume}. The output is a series of 3-D binary images at different time steps of the simulation. The adjustable parameters are the time step $t_{\mathrm{step}}$, the number of time steps $n$ and the interface sharpness parameter $\varepsilon$. The different ranges used for those parameters in this work are given in Table \ref{tab:variables}. In Figure \ref{fig:eboni_sous_volume} the effect of the curvature-driven evolution is illustrated with ice sublimation on high curvature surfaces and water vapor deposition on low curvature surfaces.

% ARTEFACTS
Finally, corrections were necessary to limit some artefacts of the model. First, as the model is base on periodic boundary conditions applied on the images , it may lead to errors in estimating curvature at the image boundaries, which results in very high curvatures. The edges of the simulated images were thus cut off of at certain width (0.6 mm) prior to further analysis.\\ 
Also, as the model does not account for gravity, simulations can lead to create ``floating" ice grains \cite<see>{flin_full_2003, vetter_simulating_2010},  especially for snow in early stages of metamorphism that undergo significant settling \cite{schleef2014influence}. 
% An example of grain disconnections is shown in Figure \ref{fig:disco}. 
To prevent this non-physical phenomenon, we restrict input images to adequate snow microstructures and suppress disconnected ice grains.

 The model output is a series of $n$ images separated by a time step $t_{\mathrm{step}}$, without any notion of physical duration. To obtain physical simulation evolution, a calibration step is thus needed.
Considering the non-dimensional time used to deduce the dimensionless equation \eqref{eq:allen-cahn}, the model physical time can be expressed as \cite{bretin_and_denis_discrete-continuous_2015}: 
\begin{equation}\label{equ:alpha}
   t = \frac{\Tilde{t}\ d_x^2}{\alpha v_{\mathrm{kin}} d_0}
\end{equation}
with $t$ the physical time (s) and $\Tilde{t} = t_{\mathrm{step}} \times n$ the simulated time (-). As the only poorly determined parameter, the condensation coefficient $\alpha$ is needed to determine the physical time. To derive a value of $\alpha$, we compare a simulated series with the experimental series of \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} (cf Table \ref{tab:series_exp}) using the time evolution of the SSA parameter. The $\alpha$ coefficient is calibrated using the SSA because it is a good scalar descriptor of the microstructure evolution.\\
The series is composed of 10 micro-tomographic images showing snow at different times of its evolution in ETM at -2$^\circ$C, from 0 to 84 days. The series used samples that were extruded in the central part of the snow slab (same vertical positions, different horizontal locations) for each tomographic scan. The first images of the series of \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} (Iso01, Iso03, Iso04) correspond to fresh snow and were not used to avoid grain disconnection issues (Sec. \ref{subsec:model}).\\
The calibration process is schematized in 5 steps in Figure \ref{fig:workflow}. For each selected image of the experimental series taken successively as input: \\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We use the model Snow-3D with the same parameters ($n$ = 10, $t_{\mathrm{step}}$ = 16, $\varepsilon$ = 3) to obtain a simulated series composed of 10 images. 
    \item We calculate the SSA evolution of the series during the simulation (Graphs b).
    \item We fit the SSA of the simulated series (Graph b) to the SSA of the experimental series (Graph a) by adjusting the time axis. More precisely, we scale the simulation steps to the experimental time such that they match the experiment best by minimizing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the two curves (Graph c).   
    \item We use the simulation and the fitted physical time to derive a value of the condensation coefficient $\alpha$ through the equation \eqref{equ:alpha}. 
\end{enumerate}

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{Figures/workflow_aff.pdf}
    \caption{Workflow of the time calibration approach.}
    \label{fig:workflow}
\end{figure}
We apply those steps to the image Iso05 (day 5), Iso08 (day 12), Iso11 (day18) and Iso15 (day 33). The last three images of the experimental series (Iso19, Iso21, and Iso23) are not used as they are close in time to the end of the experiment, which prevents a precise estimation of $\alpha$. We remove on each side of the simulated image a layer with a thickness equal to the size of two heterogeneities (0.6 mm) before the SSA calculation to avoid edge artefacts while keeping volumes larger than the SSA elementary representative volume (REV), typically about 2.5 mm for this type of snow \cite<e.g.>{flin2011computations}. The average and the standard deviation are calculated on the 4 resulting $\alpha$ coefficients. The resulting condensation coefficient is $\alpha = ( 9.8 \pm 0.7) 10^{-4}$. As $\alpha$ is known to be strongly temperature dependent and the temperature condition of \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} is -2$^\circ$C, the calibrated model can only be used to simulate ETM at this temperature. To evaluate the influence of $\alpha$ on the microstructural parameters, we calculate the variation of the microstructural parameters (SSA, covariance length, mean curvature) as a function of $\alpha$ variation. In the range of the $\alpha$ derived from the different samples, the parameters only have a maximum alteration of 5\%, which is small compared to the physical precision of those parameters. 

\subsection{Computation of snow properties}
\label{subsec:methode_physical_appli}



To characterize our simulated and experimental microstructures, we calculated on our volumes a range of microstructural and physical properties.

\noindent \textbf{Microstructural properties}$\quad$ To describe the structure of our snow images at fine scale, we computed microstructural properties on the volumes using specific algorithms. The properties used are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The snow density $\rho_{\mathrm{s}}$ (kg m$^{-3}$) computed with a simple voxel counting algorithm.
    
    \item The mean curvature (mm$^{-1}$), defined as $\left(C_{min} + C_{max})\right/2$ with $C_{min}$ and $C_{max}$ respectively the minimum and maximum 2-D normal curvatures at one point of the surface. As those values are computed for each point of the surface, they are represented as statistical distributions. Values near 0 mm$^{-1}$ correspond to flat surfaces, positive values to convex surfaces, and negative values to concave surfaces; the higher the values, the more concave or convex the surfaces \cite{ogawa2006representation}. The mean curvature is expressed in terms of occurrence ratio, which gives the percentage of the ice surface area that exhibits a mean curvature located in a particular curvature class.
    
    \item The specific surface area SSA (m$^2$ kg$^{-1}$), defined as the total surface area of ice per unit of mass \cite{dumont2021experimental, flin2011computations}.
    
    \item  The covariance (or correlation) length $l_{c}$, calculated along the x-, y-and z- direction of the images, corresponds to the characteristic size of the ice heterogeneities in a given snow microstructure \cite{lowe2013general}. 
    
    \item The anisotropy coefficient
    $\mathcal{A}(\star)$, that can be computed for each microstructural and physical property which are computed along 3 dimensions. This coefficient is defined as the ratio between the vertical component over the horizontal ones, such as $\mathcal{A}(\star)=\star_{z} / \star_{x y}$. The property is considered isotropic if it exhibits a coefficient close to 1, otherwise the property is anisotropic. For example, $\mathcal{A}(l_c)$ largely above 1 means that the covariance length is higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal one, and thus describes a structure that is vertically elongated.

\noindent \textbf{Macro-scale transport properties}$\quad$ The 3-D tensors of the intrinsic permeability  $\mathbf{K}$ (m$^2$), of the effective thermal conductivity $\mathbf{k}$ (W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$) and of the effective coefficient of vapor diffusion  $\mathbf{D}$ (m$^2$ s$^{-1}$) were computed on a set of simulated 3-D images. For each property, a specific boundary value problem, arising from a homogenization technique \cite{auriault2009homogenization, calonne2015macroscopic}, is solved on the images applying periodic boundary conditions on the external boundaries of each volume using the software Geodict \cite{thoemen_3d_2008}. The effective diffusion coefficient was computed with an artificial diffusion coefficient of gas in free air set to $D^{\mathrm{air}} =$ 1 m$^2$ s$^{-1}$. In this study, we present the normalized values of the effective diffusion $\mathbf{D} / D^{\mathrm{air}}$ (dimensionless). $\mathbf{K}$ is normalized by the equivalent sphere radius $r_{\mathrm{es}}=3/(\mathrm{SSA} \times \rho_{\mathrm{i}})$ to introduce a dimensionless tensor: $\mathbf{K}\mathrm{^{*}} = \mathbf{K}/r_{\mathrm{es}}^2$  \cite{calonne_3D_2012}.
As the non-diagonal terms of the tensor $\mathbf{K}$, $\mathbf{k}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ are negligible, we consider only the diagonal terms, i.e. seen as the eigenvalues of the tensors (the image axes $x$, $y$ and $z$ are the principal directions of the microstructure, $z$ being along the direction of gravity). Besides, the tensors are transversely isotropic as the components in $x$ are very similar to the ones in $y$.
In the following, $K$, $k$ and $D$ refer to the average of the diagonal terms of $\mathbf{K}$, $\mathbf{k}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ respectively. $K_z$, $k_z$ and $D_z$ refer to the vertical components and $K_{xy}$, $k_{xy}$ and $D_{xy}$ refer to the mean horizontal components where $K_{xy} = (K_{x} + K_{y}) /2$, $k_{xy} = (k_{x} + k_{y}) /2$ and $D_{xy} = (D_{x} + D_{y}) /2$. Finally, the anisotropy of the properties is characterized based on the anisotropy ratio $\mathcal{A}(K) = K_z / K_{xy}$, $\mathcal{A}(k) = k_z / k_{xy}$ and $\mathcal{A}(D) = D_z / D_{xy}$ \cite<see e.g.>{calonne_study_2014}.


\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
\subsection{Model evaluation}
\label{Section:Calibration}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/microstruct_isoFlin_exp_simu.pdf}
    \caption{Comparison between the simulation and the experiment of \protect\citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} taking the iso05 sample as the model input. a) SSA ; b) covariance length ; c) mean curvature histograms.}
    \label{fig:flin_evaluation}
\end{figure}

Here, we evaluate the calibrated model by comparing experiments and simulations. We first evaluate the model results with the time series of \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} i.e. the dataset used to calibrate the model through the condensation coefficient (Sec. \ref{subsec:calib}), using  Iso05 (RG) as initial image. We also use the experimental series of \citeA{hagenmuller_motion_2019} to allow for an independent comparison.\\

The series of \citeA{hagenmuller_motion_2019} (Table \ref{tab:series_exp}) is a 110 h long experiment of ETM at -2$^\circ$C with 32 tomographic images. The series was used to study dust particles in snow under TGM and ETM conditions with a dust content of 0.5 mg g$^{-1}$. We assume that dust has little influence on ETM, and to use the images as model inputs, the dust particles were converted to air. Here we focus on the equi-temperature part of the experiment (approx. 70 h of ETM and 20 tomographic images). In the work of \citeA{hagenmuller_motion_2019}, the snow sample was observed with in operando X-ray tomography, meaning than the same sample was scanned at regular intervals. It enables to compare directly simulated and experimental images, unlike the \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} series for which each image corresponds to a different sample.\\

Results of SSA, covariance length and mean curvature for each time series are shown in Figure \ref{fig:flin_evaluation} and \ref{fig:eboni}, respectively. As expected, simulations follow closely the SSA decrease reported in the experiment of \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} (Fig \ref{fig:flin_evaluation}.a).
The RMSE is of $0.58\ \mathrm{m}^2\ \mathrm{kg}^{-1}$ for SSA values evolving from 35 to 18 m$^2$ kg$^{-1}$.
Covariance lengths increase over time from around 0.07 to 0.12 mm. This overall evolution is well reproduced by the model with a small RMSE of $0.005\ \mathrm{mm}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:flin_evaluation}.b). Looking in more details, the snow microstructure gets slightly elongated in the horizontal direction with covariance length about 0.02 mm higher in the horizontal direction than in the vertical one. This is not captured in the simulations in which differences between the lengths in both directions remains rather constant over time and do not exceed 0.005 mm. We should however keep in mind that the experimental data do not only reflect a time evolution but also the spatial variability of the snow layer monitored in \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} and the settling, the latter being not considered in simulations, as explained in Section \ref{sec:method}. This might explain the small disagreement observed in covariance lengths.
Finally, the mean curvature distribution presented in Figure \ref{fig:flin_evaluation}.c allows to qualitatively compare the evolution of grain surface morphology. We see the distributions are narrowing and shift toward lower mean curvature values, especially in the first time period. This depicts that ice surfaces are getting more uniform towards larger rounded grains. The evolution of the experimental and simulated data are very similar, with a good agreement at each time step.\\

 Over the  period of 70 hours used from the \citeA{hagenmuller_motion_2019} experiment, changes are more subtle. SSA decreases from 33 to 28 m$^2$ kg$^{-1}$, whereas covariance length increases from 0.077 to 0.087 mm in the horizontal direction and from 0.065 to 0.072 mm in the vertical one. The model performs well for the SSA with a RMSE of $0.79\ \mathrm{m}^2\ \mathrm{kg}^{-1}$ and, even better for the covariance length with a RSME of $0.0003\ \mathrm{mm}$ (mean for both directions).
The rate of SSA decrease seems slightly underestimated by the model, reaching a difference of $1.47\ \mathrm{m}^2\ \mathrm{kg}^{-1}$ after 80 h; this is still small with respect to the SSA value range. Overall good agreements are found for the mean curvature distribution (Fig. \ref{fig:eboni}.c). \\

\subsection{Model prediction}
\label{sec:prediction}

After considering the calibration evaluation, the model is used to predict equi-temperature metamorphism effects on different snow experimental images (Table \ref{tab:series_sim}). We selected four 3-D experimental images of snow showing various features and used them as input image in the model. The samples are I17 (DF), which present an isotropic structure with rounded shapes, TG2 (FC/DH), Grad3 (DH), and 7G9m (DH). The 3 last images underwent various temperature gradient with an effect increasingly pronounced (see Table \ref{tab:series_sim}). The simulations were performed with isothermal conditions at a temperature T = -2$^\circ$C and $\alpha = 9.8\ 10^{-4}$. It led to 4 series of 4 to 11 images simulating from 70 days to 80 days of ETM. This time range enables to capture the important physical evolution while keeping simulation times close to those of the calibration. In Figure \ref{fig:evolutions_3D}, we see the simulated series of our 4 samples, with a perspective view of three steps for each series, and vertical slices associated to those steps.\\



\subsubsection{Microstructural parameters}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width =\linewidth]{Figures/evolution_3D_new_textepetit_courr.pdf}
    \caption{Initial, intermediate and final stage of the simulated series of Grad3, 7G9m, TG2 and I17. 3-D views and vertical slices taken at the center of each cube are shown.}
    \label{fig:evolutions_3D}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:histo_i17_grad3}, we see the mean curvature distribution evolution for I17 (DF) and Grad3 (DH) samples (Sec. \ref{subsec:methode_physical_appli}). For I17 simulated evolution (Figure \ref{fig:histo_i17_grad3}.a), the initial upward and downward distributions are similar with a peak of mean curvature located around 4 mm$^{-1}$ and an occurrence ratio of 5 \%. It shows that this sample was initially isotropic. With time, the area-averaged mean curvature decreases gradually, and the distributions are narrowing as the ice structure tends to become larger and more uniform.\\
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/histo_i17_grad3_copie_invert.pdf}
    \caption{Time evolution of the mean curvature distribution from the downward (left) and upward (right) surfaces of I17 (a) and Grad3 (b) simulated series. Each curvature class is 0.5 mm$^{-1}$ wide.}
    \label{fig:histo_i17_grad3}
\end{figure}

For Grad3 evolution (Figure \ref{fig:histo_i17_grad3}.b), the initial upward and downward distributions are wider than for I17 initial sample. It can be explained by the large variety of shapes encountered in Grad3 and not in I17 that already presents homogeneous rounded shapes. For Grad3, the initial upward and downward surfaces exhibit clearly distinct distributions: the peak of mean curvature is located around 0 mm$^{-1}$ for the downward ones, and at 1.5 mm$^{-1}$ for the upward ones. The near 0 downward distribution depicts the plane surfaces that are typically found downward a depth hoar structure, unlike the upward outlook that presents more rounded shapes. With time, the area-averaged mean curvature stays very low but the distributions are narrowing (approx. 7 \% occurrence ratio), showing the same trend as I17.\\

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/4images_microstruct_new.pdf}
    \caption{Microstructural parameters of the simulated series.}
    \label{fig:4_images_microstruct}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:4_images_microstruct} shows microstructural parameters (SSA, covariance length, structural anisotropy) of our 4 simulated series. For the SSA graph, we see an exponential decrease for each image, which matches with ETM experiments and similar models \cite<see e.g.>{kaempfer_observation_2007, vetter_simulating_2010}. Each series shows different decreasing rate and shape, ranging from Grad3 showing an exponential decrease from 23.7 to 9.2 m$^2$ kg$^{-1}$ to the almost linear slope of I17 curve from 20.6 to 13.7 m$^2$ kg$^{-1}$. This difference in decrease rate is due to the initial microstructure. Grad3 shows a high initial SSA value, with sharp edges and facets that evolve quickly under isothermal conditions, unlike the sample I17 that presents rounded shapes in its initial stage.
The covariance length evolution shows the characteristic increase of the ETM, reflecting the growth of snow grains and pores \cite{calonne_study_2014, lowe2011interfacial}. Different evolution rates are again observed, from an increase of 0.05 mm for I17 to 0.09 mm for Grad3. Finally, looking at the anisotropy ratio evolution provides surprising results. The samples I17 and TG2 presenting a rather isotropic structure, with ratio close to 1, show no changes over time. Samples initially anisotropic, however, show an increase of their anisotropy, as Grad3 increasing from 1.44 to 1.62 through the simulation and, in a lesser way, 7G9m ranging from 1.24 to 1.27. By the end of the simulations, Grad3 covariance length is about two times larger in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction. This increase in anisotropy can also be seen in the slices and 3-D images (Fig. \ref{fig:evolutions_3D}): the initial vertically elongated structure is strengthening with the growing of vertical columns. This is an interesting result as one could think that a sample presenting a strong anisotropy would tend to lose it for the benefit of a more isotropic structure under the effect of a long equi-temperature exposure.



\subsubsection{Macro-scale transport properties}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Figures/4images_transport_temps_court.pdf}
    \caption{Evolution of the macro-scale transport properties for I17 and Grad3 simulated series.}
    \label{fig:transport_temps}
\end{figure}

In this section we present 3-D estimates of macroscopic transport properties (Sec. \ref{subsec:methode_physical_appli}) calculated on the simulated series predicting ETM on 4 different microstructures (Sec. \ref{sec:prediction}). Figure \ref{fig:transport_temps} presents the evolution of the transport properties for the samples I17 and Grad3. Wee see that the two samples evolve on different ranges on those properties, and that Grad3 seems to have a significant anisotropy compared to I17.

The figure also display the evolution in density during the simulations. Those density changes are also visible in Figure \ref{fig:Tplot} with a maximum of 10 kg m$^{-3}$ (3 \%) increase for the TG2 series and a minimum of 4 kg m$^{-3}$ (1 \%) for the Grad3 series. As the model is based on ice mass conservation, these slight density changes correspond to artefacts. They could be caused by discretization effects of the phase-field function, leading to some inaccuracy in the images at the voxel scale (see Sec. \ref{sec:disc} for complementary discussion on this topic).

In Figure \ref{fig:Tplot}, the estimations are displayed along with isotropic models based on simplified microstructures (effective coefficient of diffusion \textbf{D}) and current regressions (effective thermal conductivity \textbf{k} and permeability \textbf{K}). The regression from \citeA{calonne_3D_2012} is used for the permeability. For the conductivity we use the regression of \citeA{calonne_numerical_2011} obtained using images of snow spanning a wide range of seasonal snow types. The self-consistent estimate of diffusion for spherical inclusions $D_{\mathrm{SC}}$ from \citeA{calonne_macroscopic_2014} is shown for the coefficient of diffusion: \\
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
K_{\mathrm{Calonne\ 2012}}=(3.0 \pm 0.3)\ \exp \left(\left(-0.0130 \pm 0.0003\right) \rho_{\mathrm{s}}\right)
\end{align}
\begin{align}
k_{\mathrm{Calonne\ 2011}}=2.5 \times 10^{-6} \rho_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}-1.23 \times 10^{-4} \rho_{\mathrm{s}}+0.024\end{align}
\begin{align}
D_{\mathrm{SC}} = 1 - \frac{3\rho_s}{2\rho_i}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Figure \ref{fig:Tplot} shows 3-D estimates of permeability, effective conductivity and effective coefficient of diffusion plotted as a function of the density calculated on each image of our simulated series. To show the structural anisotropy of the samples, the tips and horizontal bars of the ``T" markers represent respectively the vertical and horizontal components. The arrows indicate the evolution direction of the simulated series in time. The relative change between the initial sample and the last step of the simulation $\tau$ is indicated in the legends for each property.

The temporal evolution of the different series in terms of macro-scale properties and density, represented by the arrows and by the relative changes $\tau$, mostly follow the reference parameterizations. This shows that the predicted ETM is in overall good agreement with the expected evolution of those macroscopic properties. 

Grad3 and 7G9m evolution in \textbf{D} are the only series estimates evolving in opposition with the reference parameterization. Those trends can be interpreted as an effect of the microstructure. Indeed, from fig. 9 of \citeA{calonne_macroscopic_2014}, we know that when density increases, $D$ decreases. We also see that for a given density, effective vapor diffusion is smaller for depth hoar samples than for faceted crystals and even more for rounded grains samples. As Grad3 and 7G9m samples evolve from depth hoar to more rounded shapes (Figure \ref{fig:evolutions_3D}) while increasing in density, the changes in microstructure and in density have an opposite effect on the coefficient of diffusion, and the microstructure influence could overcome the increase in density. \\
This microstructure influence is also present for the permeability, as seen in Figure 1 of \citeA{calonne_3D_2012}. In this figure, the permeability regression decreases when the density increases, but at a given density, depth hoar seems to have higher permeability than faceted crystals or rounded grains. For Grad3 and 7G9m, both the microstructure and the density evolution lead to a decreasing permeability.\\
For the thermal conductivity, the microstructure impact is not that distinct in the Figure 1 of \citeA{calonne_numerical_2011} and the simulations seem to follow the regression in Figure \ref{fig:Tplot}.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}

This work provides a new ETM model applicable on real 3-D tomographic images. This optimized model has been calibrated and evaluated using experimental ETM series, and used for metamorphism prediction on a large range of microstructures by characterizing the images using numerous microstructural and macro-scale transport properties.

% The Snow-3D model is reliable for modeling ETM to some extent: it only consider sublimation-deposition, setting settling and water vapor transport processes aside and constraining the choice of the input microstructures.

Having the results in mind, it is worth while discussing the model artefacts in some more details. 
% density increase ------------
For our 4 simulated series, we observe an increase in density in Figure \ref{fig:Tplot} and Figure \ref{fig:transport_temps} whereas the model does not simulate changes in density. This is thus an artefact that contradicts mass conservation. This error seems to occur during the binarization of the phase-field function. At the end of the simulation, the continuous interface of the phase-field function is approximated by air and ice voxels of finite length. This step can induce at most an error of one layer of voxels on the ice-air interface. Those voxels constitute 9 \% of TG2 and 6 \% of Grad3 ice phase, which cover the mass gain observed in the simulations. In Figure \ref{fig:cubes}, we run the model on four different images: a cube surrounded by air with a size of 40$^3$ voxels; the same cube with a size of 400$^3$ voxels; the complement of the cube - a cube of air surrounded by ice - with a size of 40$^3$ voxels and the same image at 400$^3$ voxels. The idea is to test the simulated density evolution for different resolutions and shapes, with an image presenting convex shapes (the cube) and with one presenting concave shapes (the cube complement). We see clearly in the graph that for a fine resolution, the density is stable in time, whereas for a coarser resolution, the density has an erratic progression, with loss and gain of about 10 \%. Indeed, the finer the resolution, the thinner the layer of voxel of the ice surface and the lower the error. In terms of ratio between the object length (covariance length) and the voxel size, the data of Figure \ref{fig:Tplot} are similar to the cube of 40$^3$ voxels. %Furthermore, the ratio between the elements size and the resolution gets larger from I17, to TG2 to Grad3 and to 7G9m, as the density changes gets smaller.
In our data, the maximum density increase is of 3 \% for the TG2 series. It is however within the precision range of snow density measurements such as the box cutter that have a precision of 5 \% \cite{proksch2016intercomparison}. Moreover, the settling process has an important role in ETM. For example in \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} the density increases of 60 \% in 80 days. Thus, the artefact is small in comparison with the measurement precision and the observed settling, and it enables to investigate the impact of slight density variations.\\

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figures/cubes_compl_density_propre.pdf}
    \caption{Influence of the image resolution on the modeled density evolution: example of a cube surrounded by air and its complementary image.}
    \label{fig:cubes}
\end{figure}
% ---------------------------- 1ere itération
%In Figure \ref{fig:Tplot} we also see a gap between the first image of each series, which is the experimental one, and the simulated ones. This gap can be caused by the first step of the algorithm, which modify the image to conform it to the model constraints.\\
% Calibration et validation -------------
Other points worth discussing are the calibration and the model evaluation. The condensation coefficient $\alpha$ is approximated by an isotropic constant value. This hypothesis has however never been verified and $\alpha$ seems to have numerous dependencies. For example, \citeA{libbrecht2019snow} highlighted dependencies in temperature, supersaturation and crystalline orientation. He measured basal and prismatic $\alpha$ on growing snow crystal, with results between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-1}$.
In our calibration process, the $\alpha$ parameter is determined using an experimental series of \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} obtained at -2$^\circ$C. In view of $\alpha$ complex dependencies, its calibrated value can incorporate non-modeled experimental conditions (temperature variations, vapor diffusion...).
To test and evaluate the calibration, we use the equi-temperature time series of \citeA{hagenmuller_motion_2019}, also realized at -2$^\circ$C. As the experimental time series is very short compared to \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} (3 days versus 28 days), the comparison with the microstructural properties is relatively weak and would benefit of a comparison with a longer independent series of ETM. 
% ------------ Prediction

Finally, concerning the ETM prediction, the notable result is the enhancement of structural anisotropy for the very anisotropic depth hoar sample Grad3. The Grad3 experimental sample (DH) has a particular morphology: it presents a dense structure with many intricate angular shapes. On a larger scale, the sample seems to be organized into vertical shapes. With ETM, the general smoothing seems to remove small shapes to let the general structure appear with the formation of wide vertical columns, increasing the value of the structural anisotropy. A conservation of the anisotropy is also observed for 7G9m, without significant increase. One can still question if this result is particular to this only two-scale sample or if it can be generalized for any strongly anisotropic sample. 

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

A snow ETM model, based on the work of \citeA{bretin_phase-field_2019} was applied to snow images obtained by X-ray tomography to study the impact on the microstructural and transport properties. The model was calibrated to experimental data at – 2°C by fitting the SSA of the series from \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} to the simulation. A value of the condensation coefficient $\alpha$ was derived: $\alpha = ( 9.8 \pm 0.7) 10^{-4}$. The calibrated model was then evaluated with the independent experimental series of \citeA{hagenmuller_motion_2019} by looking at microstructural properties such as the SSA, the covariance length, the structural anisotropy and the mean curvature. As this evaluation raised very encouraging results, the model Snow-3D was used to model ETM on four different snow microstructures from experimental samples. The four simulated time series were used to analyze microstructural parameters (SSA, covariance length, structural anisotropy) and physical effective transport properties (thermal conductivity, vapor diffusivity and permeability). Those results are in good agreement with current models and regressions. They also exhibit the influence of the microstructure on micro-scale (structural anisotropy) and macro-scale (effective coefficient of diffusion) phenomenon. For example, we observed an enhancement of the structural anisotropy in the case of initially anisotropic microstructures. It questions the idea that isotropic conditions tend to remove the snow structure anisotropy. This model is a step forward for modeling ETM at the pore scale. Future studies will focus on implementing the settling process and water vapor transport in pores, as well on studying the condensation coefficient depending on various parameters such as the temperature.
