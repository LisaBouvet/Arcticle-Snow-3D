\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Dry snow laying on the ground is a complex material made of an ice skeleton in an air matrix that undergoes continuous transformations. Especially, snow evolves through processes of mass redistribution due to thermodynamic mechanisms called snow metamorphism. Different types of snow metamorphism take place depending on the temperature and humidity conditions as well as on the snow microstructure itself. Considering metamorphism is key as it impacts snowpack physical properties, including mechanical properties involved in avalanche processes or thermo-physical properties that drive the surface energy budget of snowpacks \cite{vionnet_detailed_2012, lehning_physical_2002}.\\

Equi-temperature metamorphism (ETM), also referred as isothermal metamorphism, occurs in snow in quasi-isothermal conditions and is driven by curvature gradients at the ice-air interface. Low curvature ice surfaces have a lower saturation water vapor than the high curvature ones. Those curvature gradients lead thus to gradients of saturation vapor density causing vapor transfer across the pores (e.g. diffusion) as well as phase changes (sublimation and deposition). Ice sublimates on higher curvature surfaces and  water vapor deposits on lower curvature surfaces. At the grain scale, the strong concavities and convexities are replaced by rounder surfaces, and bounds are created between grains. The overall structure of snow gets rounder, coarser, and more sintered \cite{colbeck_thermodynamics_1980}. These morphological changes come together with mechanical grain rearrangement leading to snow settling. The resulting type of snow is referred to as rounded grains (RG) by The International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground \cite{fierz2009international}. Equi-temperature metamorphism is constantly taking place in snow but at different levels of intensity. The higher the contrast in curvature and the higher the snow temperature, the more active the equi-temperature metamorphism. In the presence of high temperature gradients, the influence of curvature effects becomes insignificant as the effect of the temperature gradient metamorphism (TGM) predominates.\\

Modeling the physical processes of metamorphism at fine scale requires the  description of the snow microstructure and its evolution (moving interfaces) as well as water vapor transport across the microstructure. Models can be applied on simplified geometry, as in  \citeA{miller_microstructural_2003} who considered a 2D regular network of spherical grains, or on real snow microstructure, taking as inputs 3D images of elementary representative volume of snow obtained from microtomography ($\upmu$CT). To enable 3D modeling, different choices of approximation can be used: kinetics at the interface i.e. considering instantaneous diffusion in the pores ; kinetics and diffusion are considered ; kinetics, diffusion and settling are modeled.  \citeA{flin_full_2003} considered fully curvature-driven snow metamorphism based on the kinetic limited assumption, and simulated it with an iterative method on 3D tomographic images. Comparisons between modeled and experimental microstructures is also shown. \citeA{vetter_simulating_2010} used a Monte-Carlo algorithm to simulate the isothermal metamorphism with the kinetic limited assumption and implemented a simple gravity model to account for settling. They obtained consistent results with observations although the model rely on experimental fitting.\\
Recently, phase-field models have been developed to handle the numerical costs and complexity \cite{kaempfer_phase-field_2009, granger_physique_2019, bretin_phase-field_2019}. \citeA{kaempfer_phase-field_2009} suggested a phase-field model for snow metamorphism considering interface kinetics and diffusion. \citeA{kaempfer_phase-field_2009} were pioneers with the phase-field method applied to snow metamorphism, and their results are consistent with observations. However, evaluations are qualitative and limited only on one temperature gradient case, mainly because of the numerical cost of the model. 
\citeA{bretin_phase-field_2019} developed a very efficient phase-field multi-phase growth model and applied it to curvature-driven interface evolution, which could be relevant for equi-temperature snow metamorphism but has only been applied to simplified geometry.\\
%
To evaluate or calibrate 3D models using experimental data, microstructural properties can be calculated on simulated snow microstructures. In \citeA{kaempfer_phase-field_2009}, the model results are compared to a 1D pseudo-analytical case using the growth speed variable. \citeA{vetter_simulating_2010} uses the SSA (Specific Surface Area) parameter and the distribution of ice thickness in the samples. In the work of \citeA{flin_full_2003} the model results are compared to experiments using the SSA and the mean covariance. Those microstructural properties, along with other properties like transport properties can also be calculated on 3D simulated images to predict a sample evolution under ETM, provided that the model is well calibrated.\\
%
Modeling the physics of snow growth requires to assign a value to the condensation parameter $\alpha$. This parameter embodies the surface physics that governs how water molecules are incorporated into the ice lattice and is thus key to model metamorphism. The $\alpha$ coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. One can think of $\alpha$ as a sticking probability, equal to the probability that a water vapor molecule striking the ice surface becomes assimilated into the crystal lattice. However, it is still poorly understood and quantified, notably because of its complex dependencies to temperature, humidity and crystalline orientation. Numerous values can be found in the literature, ranging from 10$^{-3}$ to 10$^{-1}$ \cite<e.g.,>{libbrecht_measurements_2013}. The large uncertainty on this coefficient is one of the main limiting parameter for metamorphism models accuracy.\\
In this article, we attend to go further by applying the phase-field model of \citeA{bretin_phase-field_2019} on the curvature-driven snow equi-temperature metamorphism usable on $\upmu$CT images. We calibrated the model by finding a single value of the condensation coefficient using an experimental equi-temperature series. This calibration has been evaluated on an independent ETM series. The model has been used to predict ETM on a representative range of 3D microstructures. Those results are shown along with microstructural properties and transport properties, which are analyzed and compared to current models and parameterizations.

%PHASE FIELD ET MODELE NUMERIQUE
%\color{blue}
\citeA{bretin_phase-field_2019} phase-field model simulates a multi-phase medium evolving under mean curvature flow and volume conservation of each phase. This flow is defined by an interface evolution where the normal velocity $v_n$ is proportional to the curvature C. The model minimize local curvatures while keeping constant the sample mean curvature. The morphological transformation induced by the mean curvature flow can be interpreted as "smoothing" surfaces and seems suited to model ETM as the morphological transformations are equivalent to sublimation on high curvature surfaces and deposition on negative curvature surfaces. 


% APPLICATION A LA NEIGE (EQUATIONS ETC)
This model describes ETM based on the kinetic-limited assumption: interface growth velocity depends on the interface kinetic through a condensation coefficient but does not depend on the vapor transport in the pore space. The latter is considered instantaneous, so that vapor density in air is constant and at equilibrium with temperature. Vapor transport processes in air (diffusion) is thus not described and temperature is considered isotropic and constant. Finally, the model does not include any mechanics and the settling of the ice grains is thus not represented here.\\

Under those conditions, ETM is classically described by the following set of equations \cite<e.g.>{flin_full_2003, kaempfer_phase-field_2009}:  \
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:hertz_knu}
\begin{align}
v_{n} &= \alpha v_{\mathrm{kin}} \frac{\rho_{vs}^{\mathrm{amb}} - \rho_{v s}^{\Gamma}}{\rho_{v s}^{ \Gamma }}\quad \text{on}\ \Gamma\text{,} 
\end{align}
\begin{align}
v_{k i n} &= \frac{\rho_{v s}^{\mathrm{f}}}{\rho_i}\sqrt{\frac{k T}{2 \pi m}} % vérifier la formulation de vkin ?
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\begin{subequations}\label{equ:gibbs}
\begin{align}
    \rho_{vs}^{\mathrm{amb}}=\rho_{vs}^{\mathrm{f}}\ e^{d_0 C^{\mathrm{amb}}}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    \rho_{vs}^{\Gamma}=\rho_{vs}^{\mathrm{f}}\ e^{d_0 C} \quad \text{on}\ \Gamma\text{,} 
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\noindent Equation \eqref{eq:hertz_knu} is the Hertz-Knudsen equation. It relates the curvature to the velocity normal on the interface and oriented toward the air $v_n$ and defines the kinetic velocity $v_{\mathrm{kin}}$. The interface velocity $v_n$ is driven by the difference between the ambient saturation vapor density in the pores $\rho_{vs}^{\mathrm{amb}}$ and the saturation vapor density at the interface $\rho_{vs}^{\Gamma}$.\\

\noindent Equation \eqref{equ:gibbs} is the Gibbs-Thomson relation, witch describe dependencies between saturation vapor density and curvatures using $d_0 = \lambda a^3/(k T)$ (m) the capillary length \cite{kaempfer_phase-field_2009}.
$\rho_{vs}^{\mathrm{amb}}$ is the ambient saturation vapor density in the pores in equilibrium with the whole sample mean curvature $C^{\mathrm{amb}}$. 
$\rho_{vs}^{\Gamma}$ is the saturation vapor density at an interface of local curvature $C$.\\ 
  
 \noindent $\rho_{vs}^\mathrm{f}$ is the saturation vapor density in air above a flat surface. It has been largely studied, and can be determined as a function of the temperature using one of the existing parameterizations. We use the formulation of \citeA{gofflow} which is appropriated for our range of temperature and can be found in \citeA{murphy2005review}. All the variables are presented in Table \ref{tab:variables}.

\citeA{bretin_phase-field_2019} mean curvature flow model is solved with the phase-field method which enable an implicit description of the interface using a function that varies smoothly from a value in ice to another value in air.  When adapted and applied to ETM with two-phases, air and ice, the phase-field equation can be expressed as:\\
\begin{equation}\label{eq:phase-field}\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x, t)= d_0 \alpha v_{\mathrm{kin}} \left(\Delta u(x, t)-\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2}} W^{\prime}(u)\right)\end{equation}
\noindent with $u$ the phase function defined as: \begin{equation}\label{eq:phase-func}
u(x,t) := \frac{1}{2}\left(1-\tanh\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\right)\frac{d(x,t)}{\varepsilon}
\end{equation}
and $s$ the curvilinear  abscissa, $d$ the distance function from the interface $\Gamma$, $\varepsilon$ the interface sharpness parameter, and $W$ a double-well potential $W(s):=\frac{1}{2} s^{2}(1-s)^{2}$. The distance function  is linked to the surface mean curvature C by $\Delta d(x) = C$ and to the interface normal speed $v_n$ by $\partial_t d (x,t) = - v_n$. By substituting the physical variables to non-dimensional variables such as: $\Tilde{t} = t \alpha v_{\mathrm{kin}} d_0 / d_x^2 $, $\Tilde{x} = x/d_x$ and $\Tilde{\varepsilon} = \varepsilon/d_x$ with $d_x$ (m) the input image resolution, the canonical dimensionless form of this equation is the famous Allen-Cahn equation \cite{bretin_and_denis_discrete-continuous_2015, kaempfer_phase-field_2009}:
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:allen-cahn}\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x, t)=\Delta u(x, t)-\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2}} W^{\prime}(u)\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:allen-cahn}\frac{\partial \Tilde{u}}{\partial \Tilde{t}}(\Tilde{x}, \Tilde{t})=\Delta \Tilde{u}(\Tilde{x}, \Tilde{t})-\frac{1}{\Tilde{\varepsilon}^{2}} W^{\prime}(\Tilde{u})\end{equation}

The equation \eqref{eq:allen-cahn} is the general form of the phase-field equation. In the model another term is added on the form of a Lagrangian multiplier to guarantee the volume conservation \cite<See>{bretin_phase-field_2019}.

%% ARTEFACTS
%The model takes as input a binary 3D tomographic image of a snow sample as in Figure \ref{fig:eboni_sous_volume} where the effect of the curvature-driven evolution is illustrated with ice sublimation on high curvature surfaces and water vapor %deposition on low curvature surfaces, leading to rounding, coarsening and sintering the ice structure. The adjustable parameters are the time step $t_{step}$, the number of time steps $n$ and the interface sharpness parameter $\varepsilon$. The %output is a series of 3D binary images that underwent the mean curvature flow. Artefacts are induced by the sample geometry during the simulation, including: 
%\begin{itemize}[label=-]
%\item Edge effect: Due to the periodic boundary conditions of the model, some curvature misestimations may occur at the edge of snow 3D volumes, i.e., snow grains may be considered as cut by the borders of the image, leading to very high curvatures. %To avoid those errors  in this area of the sample, we chose to cut a certain width of the image edges on the simulation output images before the calculation of the microstructural properties.\\
%\vspace{0.1cm}
%
%\item Grain disconnection: As the model does not simulate gravity, when particles are disconnected because of morphological evolution, they tend to ``float" in the air phase before getting small enough to disappear. To prevent this non physical %phenomenon, we suppress disconnected ice particles during the simulation, and we chose as inputs snow samples that already underwent preliminary stages of metamorphism and settling. An example of disconnections is shown in Figure \ref{fig:disco}. 
%% As an example, we loose 6.10$^{-4}$ g of Grad3 sample (0.08 g) during the simulated 75 days of ETM with the suppression of disconnected particles.

The resulting software is called Snow-3D. The model takes as input a 3D binary image of snow microstructure, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:eboni_sous_volume}. The output is a series of simulated 3D binary images at different time steps of the simulation. The adjustable parameters are the time step $t_{\mathrm{step}}$, the number of time steps $n$ and the interface sharpness parameter $\varepsilon$. The different ranges used for those parameters in this work are given in Table \ref{tab:variables}. In Figure \ref{fig:eboni_sous_volume} the effect of the curvature-driven evolution is illustrated with ice sublimation on high curvature surfaces and water vapor deposition on low curvature surfaces, leading to rounding, coarsening and sintering the ice structure.

% ARTEFACTS
Finally, some corrections were necessary to limit some artefacts of the model. Periodic boundary conditions are applied on the images. It leads to errors in estimating curvature at the image boundaries resulting in very high curvatures. The edges of the simulated images were thus cut off of a certain width (0.6 mm) prior to further analysis. Also, as the model does not simulate gravity, simulations can lead to create ``floating" ice grains,  especially for snow in early stages of metamorphism and settling such as fresh snow. An example of grain disconnections is shown in Figure \ref{fig:disco}. To prevent this non-physical phenomenon, we restrict simulations to adequate snow microstructures and process the simulated images such as disconnected ice grains were suppressed. 
% As an example, we loose 6.10$^{-4}$ g of Grad3 sample (0.08 g) during the simulated 75 days of ETM with the suppression of disconnected particles.

\end{table}

\subsection{Calibration} 
\label{subsec:calib}
To be able to compare our results to experiments or to use them to predict ETM, a calibration step is needed. The model output is a series of $n$ images separated by a time step $t_{\mathrm{step}}$, without any notion of physical duration of the simulated ETM.
Considering the non-dimensional time used to deduce the dimensionless equation \eqref{eq:allen-cahn}, the model physical time can be expressed as \cite{bretin_and_denis_discrete-continuous_2015}: 
\begin{equation}\label{equ:alpha}
   t = \frac{\Tilde{t}\ d_x^2}{\alpha v_{\mathrm{kin}} d_0}
\end{equation}
with $t$ the physical time (s) and $\Tilde{t} = t_{\mathrm{step}} \times n$ the simulated time (-). As the only unclear parameter is $\alpha$, finding a value of this parameter is needed to scale the simulation time to dimensional time. To find a value of $\alpha$, a simulated series will be compared to a part of the experimental series of \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} (cf Table \ref{tab:series_exp}) through the time evolution of the SSA parameter.\\
The series corresponds to 10 tomographic images of snow microstructure showing snow at different time of its evolution in ETM at -2$^\circ$C, from 0 to 84 days. The series used samples that were extruded at different locations of the snow slab for each tomographic scan. The first images of the series of \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} correspond to fresh snow and were not used to avoid grains disconnections issues (Sec. \ref{subsec:model}). $\alpha$ have been calibrated using the SSA because it is a good scalar descriptor of the microstructure evolution.\\
The calibration process is schematized in 5 steps in Figure \ref{fig:workflow}. For each selected image of the experimental series taken successively as input: \\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We used the model Snow-3D to obtain a simulated series composed of 10 images. 
    \item We calculated the SSA evolution of the series during the simulation (Graphs b) and c)).
    \item We fitted the SSA of the simulated series to the SSA of the experimental series (Graph a)) by adjusting the time axis. More precisely, we scaled the simulation steps to the real time (Equation \eqref{equ:alpha}) such that they match the experiment best by minimizing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the two curves.   
    \item We used the simulation time and the fitted physical time to find a value of the condensation coefficient $\alpha$ through the equation \eqref{equ:alpha}). 
\end{enumerate}

\hspace*{-0.2cm}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{Figures/workflow_aff.pdf}
    \caption{Workflow of the time calibration approach}
    \label{fig:workflow}
\end{figure}
Those steps have been applied to the image Iso05, Iso08, Iso11 and Iso15, from 5 days to 33 days. The last three images of the experimental series (Iso19, Iso21, and Iso23) were not used as they are close in time to the end of the experiment, which prevent a precise estimation of $\alpha$. It resulted in 4 simulated series composed of 10 images simulating equi-temperature metamorphism from a different input image, i.e. from a different metamorphism stage. We removed on each side of the simulated image a layer with a thickness equal to the size of two heterogeneities (0.6 mm) before the SSA calculation to avoid edge artifacts while keeping volumes larger than REVs (representative elementary volume) for most of the properties of interest. A weighted average is calculated on the $\alpha$ coefficients using the inverse of the RMSE as weight to maximize the influence of the $\alpha$ originating from the best fit to the experimental curve. The resulting condensation coefficient is $\alpha = ( 9.9 \pm 0.6) 10^{-4}$. This uncertainty is calculated using a classical propagation of uncertainties of $\alpha$ through the equation \eqref{equ:alpha}. As the temperature condition of \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} is -2$^\circ$C, the calibrated model can only be used to simulate ETM at -2$^\circ$C. To see the influence of $\alpha$ in the microstructural parameters, we calculated the variation of the microstructural parameters as a function of $\alpha$ variation. In the range of our $\alpha$ variation through the different samples, the parameters such as density, specific surface area and covariance length (described in Section \ref{subsec:methode_physical_appli}) only have a maximum alteration of 5\%, which is small compared to the physical precision of those parameters.

To characterize our simulated and experimental microstructures, we calculated on our volumes a range of microstructural and physical properties. Those properties are defined and used as in \citeA{calonne_study_2014}.

\noindent \textbf{Microstructural properties}$\quad$ To describe the microstructure of our snow images, we computed microstructural properties on the volumes using counting and normal vectors algorithms. The properties used are:
\begin{itemize}

    \item The mean curvature MC (mm$^{-1}$), defined as $\mathrm{MC} = \left(C_{min} + C_{max})\right/2$ with $C_{min}$ and $C_{max}$ respectively the minimum and maximum 2-D curvatures at one point of the surface. As those values are computed for each point of the surface, they are represented as statistical distributions. Values near 0 mm$^{-1}$ correspond to flat surfaces, positive values are convex surfaces, and negative MC are concave surfaces; the higher the values, the more concave or convex the surfaces \cite{flin_three-dimensional_2004, brzoska2007using, wang2012curvature}. 
    % In the Figure \ref{fig:MC} in both histograms the mean decreases towards 0 with iterations, which corresponds to larger and rounded grains. In the downward mean curvature, the asymmetry at the first iterations is explained by the facets (plane surfaces) oriented downward from the TG metamorphism that will get rounder with the isothermal metamorphism model.\\
    
    \item The porosity $\phi$ (-), computed with a simple voxel counting algorithm. Snow density $\rho_{\mathrm{s}}$ is linked to the porosity  by $\rho_{\mathrm{s}}=\rho_{\mathrm{i}}(1-\phi)$ with $\rho_{\mathrm{i}}=917\ \mathrm{kg\ m^{-3}}$ the ice density.
 
    \item The specific surface area SSA (m$^2$ kg$^{-1}$), is defined by the ratio between the total ice surface of a sample and its volume of ice per mass unit: $\mathrm{SSA}=S/V \times \rho_{i}$ \cite{flin2011computations, berryman1998planar}.
    
    \item  The covariance (or correlation) length $l_{c}$, calculated along the x-, y-and z- direction of the images, provides a characteristic length of the microstructure, corresponding to the characteristic size of heterogeneities. It is used to characterize the basic microstructure geometry \cite{lowe2013general}. 
    
    \item Anisotropy coefficient
    $\mathcal{A}(\star)$, that can be computed for each microstructural and physical property that are computed along 3 dimensions. This coefficient is defined as the ratio between the vertical component over the horizontal one, such as $\mathcal{A}(\star)=\star_{z} / \star x y$. The property is considered isotropic if it exhibits a coefficient close to 1, otherwise the property is anisotropic. For example, $\mathcal{A}(l_c)$ largely above 1 means that the covariance length is higher in the vertical direction than in the horizontal one, and thus describe a structure that is vertically elongated.
\end{itemize}


\noindent \textbf{Physical properties}$\quad$ The 3D tensor of the effective coefficient of diffusion  $\mathbf{D}$ (m$^2$ s$^{-1}$), of the effective thermal conductivity tensor $\mathbf{k}$ and of the intrinsic permeability  $\mathbf{K}$ (m$^2$) were computed on the set of simulated 3D images. For each property, a specific boundary value problem, arising from a homogenization technique \cite{auriault2009homogenization, calonne2015macroscopic}, is solved on the images applying periodic boundary conditions on the external boundaries of each volume using the software Geodict \cite{thoemen_3d_2008}. The effective diffusion coefficient was computed with an artificial diffusion coefficient of gas in free air set to $D^{\mathrm{air}} =$ 1 m$^2$ s$^{-1}$. In this study, we present the normalized values of the effective diffusion $\mathbf{D} / D^{\mathrm{air}}$ (dimensionless). %These normalized values can be multiplied by the diffusion coefficient of the gas of interest in free air to get the physical, non-normalized values of effective diffusion coefficient of this gas in snow or firn (for example, the diffusion coefficient of vapor in free air, that is $2.036 \times 10^{-5}$ m$^2$ s$^{-1}$ at -10$^\circ$C \cite{massman_review_1998}, could be used to get the effective diffusion coefficient of vapor). 
$\mathbf{K}$ is normalized by the equivalent sphere radius $r_{\mathrm{es}}=3/(\mathrm{SSA} \times \rho_{\mathrm{i}})$ to introduce a dimensionless tensor: $\mathbf{K}\mathrm{^{*}} = \mathbf{K}/r_{\mathrm{es}}^2$  \cite{calonne_3D_2012}.
As the non-diagonal terms of the tensor $\mathbf{D}$, $\mathbf{k}$ and  $\mathbf{K}$ are negligible, we consider only the diagonal terms, i.e. seen as the eigenvalues of the tensors (the image axes $x$, $y$ and $z$ are the principal directions of the microstructure, $z$ being along the direction of gravity). Besides, the tensors are transversely isotropic as the components in $x$ are very similar to the ones in $y$.
In the following, $D$, $k$ and $K$ refer to the averages of the diagonal terms of $\mathbf{D}$, $\mathbf{k}$ and $\mathbf{K}$, respectively. $D_z$, $k_z$ and $K_z$ refer to the vertical components and $D_{xy}$, $k_{xy}$ and $K_{xy}$ refer to the mean horizontal components where $D_{xy} = (D_{x} + D_{y}) /2$, $k_{xy} = (k_{x} + k_{y}) /2$ and $K_{xy} = (K_{x} + K_{y}) /2$. Finally, the anisotropy of the properties is characterized based on the anisotropy ratio $\mathcal{A}(D) = D_z / D_{xy}$, $\mathcal{A}(k) = k_z / k_{xy}$ and $\mathcal{A}(K) = K_z / K_{xy}$ \cite<e.g.>{calonne_study_2014}.

\subsection{Model evaluation against experimental data}
\label{Section:Calibration}

    \label{fig:flin_evaluation}
\end{figure}

Here, we evaluate the calibrated model by comparing experiments and simulations. We compared with the time series of \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004}, the dataset used to calibrate the condensation coefficient required in the model (Sec. \ref{subsec:calib}), as well as with the one of \citeA{hagenmuller_motion_2019} to allow for an independent comparison.\\

The series of \citeA{hagenmuller_motion_2019} (Table \ref{tab:series_exp}) is a 110 h long experiment of isothermal metamorphism at -2$^\circ$C with 32 tomographic images. The series was used to study dust particles in snow under temperature gradient conditions. As our model does not work on more than 2 phases and dust is insensitive to metamorphism, the dust particles were converted to air before using it in Snow-3D. A temperature gradient of 5 K m$^{-1}$ was detected and corrected after 38 h of experiment, thus we only work with the final part of the series (approx. 70 h of isothermal metamorphism). In the work of \citeA{hagenmuller_motion_2019}, the snow sample was observed with in operando X-ray tomography, meaning than the same sample was scanned at regular intervals. It enable to compare directly simulated and experimental images, unlike for the \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} series for which comparing mean variables is preferable.\\

Results of SSA, covariance length and mean curvature for each time series are shown in Figure \ref{fig:flin_evaluation} and \ref{fig:eboni}, respectively. For the comparison with the data of \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004}, iso05, the first image used for the calibration which is a RG sample of snow scanned after 118 h of ETM, was used as initial image.\\


As expected, simulations follow closely the SSA decrease reported in the experiment of \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} (Fig \ref{fig:flin_evaluation}.a).
The RMSE is of $0.58\ \mathrm{m}^2\ \mathrm{kg}^{-1}$ for SSA values evolving from 35 to 18 m$^2$ kg$^{-1}$.
Covariance lengths increase over time from around 0.07 to 0.12 mm. This overall evolution is well reproduced by the model with a small RMSE of $0.005\ \mathrm{mm}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:flin_evaluation}.b). Looking in more details, the snow microstructure gets slightly elongated in the horizontal direction with covariance length about 0.02 mm higher in the horizontal direction than in the vertical one. This is not captured in the simulations in which differences between the lengths in both directions remains rather constant over time and do not exceed 0.005 mm. We should however keep in mind that the experimental data do not only reflect a time evolution but also the spatial variability of the snow layer monitored in \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004}, the latter being not considered in simulations, as explained in Section \ref{sec:method}. This might explain the small disagreement observed in correlation lengths.
Finally, the mean curvature distribution presented in Figure \ref{fig:flin_evaluation}.c allows to qualitatively compare the evolution of grain surface morphology. We see the distributions are narrowing and shift toward lower mean curvature values, especially in the first time period. This depicts that ice surfaces are getting more uniform towards larger rounded grains. The evolution of the experimental and simulated data are very similar, with a good agreement at each time steps.\\



 Over the 70 hours used from the \citeA{hagenmuller_motion_2019} experiment, changes are more subtle. SSA decreases from 33 to 28 m$^2$ kg$^{-1}$, whereas correlation length increases from 0.077 to 0.087 mm in the horizontal direction and from 0.065 to 0.072 mm in the vertical one. The model performs well for the SSA with a RMSE of $0.79\ \mathrm{m}^2\ \mathrm{kg}^{-1}$ and, even better for the covariance length with a RSME of $0.0003\ \mathrm{mm}$ (mean for both directions).
The rate of SSA decrease seems however slightly underestimated by the model, reaching a difference of $1.47\ \mathrm{m}^2\ \mathrm{kg}^{-1}$ after 80 h; this is still small with respect to the SSA value range.
Overall good agreements are found for the mean curvature distribution (Fig. \ref{fig:eboni}.c). \\


% The condensation coefficient $\alpha$ have been calibrated using the SSA parameter, that is a good indicator of the global sample microstructure evolution. Others global microstructural parameters are useful to describe the snow sample, such as the covariance length and the anisotropy of covariance. The mean curvature distribution gives a more detailed description of the structure. Split between the downward facing and the upward facing distributions, this variable shows the distribution of rounded or facetted grains found depending on the orientation. The curvature is the main driver parameter of the model. The microstructural parameters of \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} are shown in Figure \ref{fig:flin_evaluation} and the mean curvature distribution is shown in Figure \ref{fig:histo_flin_evaluation}.

\subsection{Model prediction: evolution of different snow microstructures during ETM}
\label{sec:prediction}

After considering the calibration evaluation and validation, the model was used to predict equi-temperature metamorphism effects on different experimental images (Table \ref{tab:series_sim}). Those samples have been chosen to constitute a representative range of snow microstructures. We ran the simulations with Snow-3D taking 4 different snow samples as initial stage, named I17 (DF), TG2 (FC/DH), Grad3 (DH), and 7G9m (DH) (see table \ref{tab:series_sim}). The simulations were performed with isothermal conditions at a temperature T = -2$^\circ$C and $\alpha = 9.9\ 10^{-4}$. It led to 4 series of 4 to 11 images simulating from 70 days to 80 days of isothermal metamorphism. This time range enables to capture the important physical evolution while remaining realistic. In Figure \ref{fig:evolutions_3D}, we see the simulated series of our 4 samples, with a perspective view of three steps for each series, and vertical slices associated to those steps.\\

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width =\linewidth]{Figures/evolution_3D_new_textepetit_courr.pdf}
    \caption{Simulated evolution 3D views and their vertical slices taken at the center of each cubes.}

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Microstructural parameters}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Figures/4_images_microstructure.pdf}
    \caption{Microstructural parameters of the simulated series.}
    \label{fig:4_images_microstruct}
\end{figure}
In Figure \ref{fig:histo_i17_grad3}, we see the mean curvature distribution evolution for I17 and Grad3 samples. They are expressed in terms of occurrence ratio, which gives the percentage of the ice surface area that exhibits a mean curvature located in a particular curvature class. Those plots exhibit the driving process of the model, and give a detailed microstructure description.\\
For I17 simulated evolution (Figure \ref{fig:histo_i17_grad3}.a), the initial upward and downward distributions are similar with a peak of mean curvature located around 4 mm$^{-1}$ and an occurrence ratio of 5 \%. It shows that this sample was initially isotropic. With time, the area-averaged mean curvature decreases gradually, and the distributions are narrowing as the ice structure tend to become larger and more uniform.\\
For Grad3 evolution (Figure \ref{fig:histo_i17_grad3}.b), the initial upward and downward distributions are wider than for I17 initial sample. It can be explained by the strong concave and convex shapes encountered in Grad3 and not in I17 that already presents rounded shapes. For Grad3, the initial upward and downward surfaces exhibit clearly distinct distributions: the peak of mean curvature is located around 0 mm$^{-1}$ for the upward ones, and at 1.5 mm$^{-1}$ for the downward ones. The near 0 upward distribution depicts the plane surfaces that are typically found when looking upward a depth hoar structure unlike the downward outlook that present more concave shapes. With time, the area-averaged mean curvature stays very low but the distributions are narrowing ( approx. 7 \% occurrence ratio), showing the same trend as I17.\\


Figure \ref{fig:4_images_microstruct} shows the microstructural parameters of our 4 simulated series. For the SSA graph, we see an exponential decrease for each image, which matches with ETM experiments and similar models \cite{vetter_simulating_2010, kaempfer_observation_2007}. Each series shows different decreasing rate and shape, ranging from Grad3 with an exponential decrease of 23.7 to 9.2 m$^2$ kg$^{-1}$ to the almost linear slope of I17 curve from 20.6 to 13.7 m$^2$ kg$^{-1}$. This difference in decrease rate  is due to the initial microstructure. Grad3 shows a high initial SSA value, with sharp edges and facets that evolve quickly under isothermal conditions, unlike the sample I17 that presents rounded shapes in its initial stage.
The covariance length evolution shows the characteristic increase of the ETM, reflecting the growth of snow grains and pores \cite{lowe2011interfacial, calonne_study_2014}. Different evolution rates are again observed, from an increase of 0.05 mm for I17 to 0.09 mm for Grad3. Finally, looking at the anisotropy ratio evolution provides surprising results. The samples I17 and TG2 presenting a rather isotropic structure, with ratio close to 1, show no changes over time. Samples initially anisotropic, however, show an increase of their anisotropy, as Grad3 increasing from 1.44 to 1.62 through the simulation and, in a lesser way, 7G9m ranging from 1.24 to 1.27. By the end of the simulations, Grad3 covariance length is about two times larger in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction. This increase in anisotropy can also be seen in the slices and 3D images: the initial vertically elongated structure is strengthening with the growing of vertical columns. This is a result of interest because one could think that a sample presenting a strong anisotropy would tend to lose it for the benefit of a more isotropic structure under the effect of a long equi-temperature exposure.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Macroscale physical properties}

In this section we present 3D estimates of macroscopic transport properties (Sec. \ref{subsec:methode_physical_appli}) calculated on the simulated series predicting ETM on a large range of microstructures (Sec. \ref{sec:prediction}). The estimations are displayed along with isotropic models based on simplified microstructures (effective coefficient of diffusion \textbf{D}) and current regressions (thermal conductivity \textbf{k} and permeability \textbf{K}). For the conductivity \textbf{k} we use the regression of \citeA{calonne_numerical_2011} obtained using images of snow spanning a wide range of seasonal snow types. The self-consistent estimate of diffusion for spherical inclusions $\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{SC}}$ from \citeA{calonne_macroscopic_2014} is shown for the effective coefficient of diffusion, and the regression from \citeA{calonne_3D_2012} is used for the normalized permeability: \\
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\mathbf{k}_{\mathrm{Calonne\ 2012}}=2.5 \times 10^{-6} \rho_{\mathrm{s}}^{2}-1.23 \times 10^{-4} \rho_{\mathrm{s}}+0.024\end{align}
\begin{align}
\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{SC}} = (3\phi - 1)/2
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\mathbf{K}_{\mathrm{Calonne\ 2012}}=(3.0 \pm 0.3)\ \exp \left(\left(-0.0130 \pm 0.0003\right) \rho_{\mathrm{s}}\right)
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

The Figure \ref{fig:Tplot} shows estimates of conductivity, effective coefficient of diffusion and permeability plotted as a function of the porosity for each image of our simulated series. To show the structural anisotropy of the samples, the tips and horizontal bars of the ``T" markers represent respectively the vertical and horizontal components. Colors correspond to the ICSSG \cite{fierz2009international} and the arrows indicate the evolution direction of the simulated series in time. The relative changes between the initial sample and the last step of the simulation, calculated for the horizontal component ($\tau_{x y}$) and for the vertical component ($\tau_{z}$) are indicated in the legends for each property.\\
 
When looking at Figure \ref{fig:Tplot}, the series show an evolution along the density axis, with a maximum of 10 kg m$^{-3}$ increase for the TG2 series and a minimum of 4 kg m$^{-3}$ for the Grad3 series. As the model is supposed to operate at constant density, this rather small density changes are an artefact caused by misestimations of curvature at the images edges. We suppose that the increase in density is distributed on the whole sample such that the arising images have a realistic microstructure (Sec. \ref{sec:disc}).

The temporal evolution of the different series in terms of the macroscale properties and of the density, represented by the arrows and by the relative changes $\tau_{x y}$ and $\tau_{x y}$, mostly follow the reference parameterizations. This shows that the predicted ETM is in overall good agreement with the expected evolution of those macroscopic properties. 

Grad3 and 7G9m evolution in \textbf{D} are the only series estimates evolving in opposition with the reference parameterization. Those trends can be interpreted with the influence of the microstructure: the Figure 9 of \citeA{calonne_macroscopic_2014} display the normalized effective vapor diffusion versus snow density with the model $D_{SC}$ and different measurements. We observe that when the density increases, $D$ essentially decreases with a given dispersion. When looking in more details, we also observe that for a given density, effective vapor diffusion is smaller for depth hoar samples than for faceted crystals and for rounded grains samples. As Grad3 and 7G9m samples evolve from depth hoar to rounded grains while increasing in density, the changes in microstructure and in density are in opposition and the microstructure influence could overcome the increase in density. \\
This microstructure influence is also present for the permeability, as seen in Figure 1 of \citeA{calonne_3D_2012}. In this figure, the permeability regression decreases when the density increases, but at a given density, depth hoar seems to have higher permeability than faceted crystals or rounded grains. For Grad3 and 7G9m, the microstructure and the density evolution lead to decreasing permeability.\\
For the thermal conductivity, the microstructure impact does not seem to be that distinct as seen in the Figure 1 of \cite{calonne_numerical_2011}.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}

The main limitation of this study concerns the Snow-3D model and its reliability for modeling isothermal snow metamorphism. The hypotheses of the model are strong and special attention should be given to stay in their extent. The main assumption is related to the physical processes considered in the model. It only computes the sublimation-deposition mechanism, setting other processes potentially occurring in the snow cover aside, in particular grain settling by gravity. The settling process is decisive in the metamorphism of fresh snow, because lots of disconnections occur between the particles at the first stages of metamorphism. Those disconnected ice particles are falling down by gravity in the ice matrix, thus compacting the snow layer. As this effect is not taken into account, one should choose input snow samples that already went through the initial stage of snow compaction. A disconnection correction is applied in the model, it removes ``floating" ice bodies, leading to a loss of mass in the snow volume. This correction was however very small in terms of grain number and mass loss for the studied samples.\\

Another part of the model limitations is the numerical artefacts. The edges of the images are not perfectly simulated due to periodic boundary conditions and the only way to avoid the resulting errors is to analyze the images by removing the borders. This effect can be in contradiction with the REV, which is the minimum size needed to compute parameters. The choice of cutting image edges has only been made for the samples used in the determination of the condensation coefficient $\alpha$, due to the small images used and the precision in SSA and in $\alpha$ needed. To have the maximum precision in all our results, we could have chosen to do so systematically before every property calculation.\\

Another point of interrogation is the time step of the model. The interface width $\varepsilon$, on which the normal vectors are computed, adds a condition on the time step such as $t_{\mathrm{step}} < \varepsilon^2/2$: if the time step exceeds this value, the model will not match the small transformations that should be simulated. Besides this condition we noted an impact of small time steps on the simulation results. This might be due to the edge effect or grid resolution issues.\\

In the computation of microstructural and physical variables, the main limitation is the calculation time. For example, the calculation of permeability can take several days for one image. As a result, we did not analyze a lot of images and only selected the amount of images needed to follow the evolution of the parameters for each series.\\

In the time calibration process, the $\alpha$ parameter has been determined using an experimental series of \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004} obtained at -2$^\circ$C. Since $\alpha$ seem to have complex dependency on several parameters, its calibrated value can be influenced by the experimental setup of \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004}. To test and validate the calibration, we used the equi-temperature time series of \citeA{hagenmuller_motion_2019}, also realized at -2$^\circ$C. In terms of SSA, the simulated results using the calibrated $\alpha$ and the experimental SSA are in the same order of magnitude, but one can notice that \citeA{hagenmuller_motion_2019} experimental SSA does not follow the decreasing exponential expected curve. As the experimental time series is very short compared to \citeA{flin_three-dimensional_2004}, it can lead to large errors for a longer duration as the given RMSE should be considered dependent on the duration of the series used for the comparison. This impression is however balanced by the comparison of experimental and simulated covariance length, showing a very good fit. It shows that even if the SSA curves does not match, the microstructural evolution under equi-temperature conditions is well simulated.


\section{Conclusion}

The application of \citeA{bretin_phase-field_2019} model to the isothermal metamorphism of snow by the condensation-sublimation process was investigated. The model has been calibrated through the only condensation coefficient $\alpha$ parameter using the SSA of the experimental series of \cite{flin_three-dimensional_2004}. The resulting value is $\alpha = ( 9.92 \pm 0.59) 10^{-4}$. An evaluation of this calibration has been made using the independent experimental series of \cite{hagenmuller_motion_2019} by looking at microstructural properties such as the SSA, the covariance length and the structural anisotropy. As this validation gave very encouraging results, the model Snow3D was used to model isothermal metamorphism on a representative range of microstructures using experimental samples. On the simulated time series, we analyzed microstructural parameters (SSA, $\mathrm{l_{cov}}$, $A_{\mathrm{l_{cov}}}$) and physical transport properties (thermal conductivity, diffusivity and permeability). The comparison of the simulations physical properties and the current related parameterizations shows that the model operates properly for different densities. The microstructural results exhibit the expected global variations for the SSA and covariance length. For the very anisotropic sample Grad3, the structural anisotropy increases with time, leading to a vertical columnar structure. It questions the idea that isotropic conditions could tend to remove the snow structure anisotropy.
